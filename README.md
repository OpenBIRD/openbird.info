#OpenBIRD.info

*BIRD* stands for *BIRD is recursive DNS*

It is a DNS service that is open to everyone.

What makes this project different is that the software and the whole database it is using are fully opened online.
Especially the database is stored online and everyone can commit to it to update the data using Git.
So it is a community maintained DNS that will always return the correct and best results.

#Why start an "Open DNS Service"?

Because even though many DNS providers now are dedicated to provide better and safer Internet for users, but most of them are not open. 
So the users cannot exactly see what the DNS provider is using.
Furthermore, those providers are defining what is "appropriate" and what is not. But we think this should be defined by users.

#Why Git?

Git is a great tool. It provides everything needed for collaborations between people in different locations.
When people commit their data, we will not immediately merge it. 
Instead we will leave it there for everyone to check and we will check it too. That ensures the data are not malicious.
